# Daily Coding Practice ðŸ§ 

Welcome to my daily coding practice repo!

Here, I solve basic to advanced coding problems from various sources like PrepInsta, LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, etc.

I solve interesting problems regularly to improve my skills in:

- **Problem Solving**
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**
- **Coding for Interviews**
- **Logical Thinking**

---

## Structure
- Each **Day-X** folder contains 1 or more problems solved on that day.
- Files are named as **Q1, Q2, ...** based on the number of questions solved.
